Woodlot App Readme

It is not possible to compile our app yourself, and that is for two reasons:
1) We have not included all the files. Android auto-generates several files for
applications, and thus the current size of our file hierarchy for this app is 92mb. 
This is too large for moodle. We can however give you the entire file hierarchy 
with a usb stick if you would like. We have included all the files we wrote ourselves,
thus this submission reflects our work in its entirety.
2) Android Studio seems to use its own in-house compiler. Therefore, the only way
to build the app is to download Android Studio. It is for this reason that we have
not included a makefile, since there is no equivalent as far as we are aware.

Because you cannot compile our code, we have included as part of our submission the 
code pre-compiled. It is called app-release.apk.

This can be installed directly onto your phone, tablet, or android emulator. 

To install it on your phone/table, attach it to your computer with a usb cord. 

On your phone, click settings, then click security. On this page enable apps from
unknown sources (it defaults to not-allowed).

On your computer, copy app-release.apk to your phone/tablet. Then on your phone 
click on this file. Android will set it up automatically. 

You can now use our app.

If you do not wish to install the app, we would be happy to showcase it on our 
own hardware.
